# Catan React Project

This project is based on the popular board game Settlers of Catan.
The project will focus on the beginning pages of a playable app.

## Deliverables
  - On Games click, fetch a list of current games being played and render the games on the page. Each game will have info on how many players are currently in, the title of the session, minimum player rank, and if the session is joinable or full. (GET)
  - On Create game click, allow user to create a new game and be persisted on the list of games. (POST)
  - On Join game click, allow user to join that game, and patch the current player count. (PATCH)
  - While the user is viewing the game, give them the option to finish the game, once the game is finished it is then removed from the list. (DELETE)
  - Allow user to sort the games by # of players, alphabetical title, and minimum player rank.

## Advanced Deliverables
  - On Leaderboards click fetch a list of users, in order of highest to lowest Rank.
  - Rank system that will award points to the user.
